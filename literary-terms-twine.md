**Figurative Language:**

Figurative language uses [[metaphor->Metaphor]], [[simile->Simile]], and [[allusion->Allusion]] to project beyond the literal meanings of words, usally to convey an [[image->Image]]. Sometimes, we call this kind of language "figure of speech" because it is often used in the non-literal sense for rhetorical or vivid effect.

When we encounter a metaphor such as "The boat plows through the water," we do not imagine a literal boat and a literal plow. Instead, we see the [[symbolic->Symbol]], or non-literal aspects of the boat (imagining it moving through water) and the plow (imagining it moving through the field). The collision between these two things (a boat from the water and a plow from the land) creates a vivid [[image->Imagery]] of //how// the boat is moving through the water. As a counterpoint, imagine a boat //flying// through the water. The boat is not literally flying; it is moving quickly.

**Text:**

Text refers to any kind of cultural production that be read or interpreted. Most often, text refers to writing--a book, poem, play, advertisement. That noted, text can also refer to any other form of cultural production: movies, music, painting, sculpture, games, televisions shows, etc. As a result, think of text as anything that can be read or interpreted.

- The way you dress can be read, so you are a kind of text (if you are wearing clothes).
- Classrooms are a kind of text--everything in a classroom signals learning, teaching, reading, writing, attentiveness.

**Context:**

Context refers to the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. Another way of understanding context is to state that it is the situation within which we understand something. Precisely, context refers to the parts of something written or spoken that immediately precede and follow a word or passage and *clarify its meaning*.

Context has a lot to do with our expectations--particularly thematic and cultural expectations. When we go to an Italian restaurant, we do not expect to see Chinese food on the menu--that would be *out* of context. When things are *in context*, we get what we expect--Italian food at an Italian restaurant. Likewise, if we are going to a "family restaurant," we do not expect haute cuisine or expensive dishes on the menu. Instead, we expect choice, stuff for kids, and reasonable prices--options. Context helps us determine the meaning of the food and governs our expectations. When I order a hamburger at a fancy restaurant, I expect an expensive, fancy, hamburger. When I go to a fast food restaurant, I do not expect an expensive, fancy, hamburger. The context determines how I "receive" the information of the hamburger.    

When we speak to context in textual analysis, or make it relevant to our reading, context is two-fold:

1.  There's the context of the words on the page, the context shaped by the **text**--the framework for understanding descriptions, motivations, activities, words, places and their role(s) in the text--and how context shapes the meaning of those things. For example, we understand that Casey is a baseball player--and a very good hitter normally--in "Casey at the Bat" because that's what the poem shows us is the context for receiving Casey. 
2. There's the context into which the **item or thing** belongs--the cultural, social, political, racial or other contexts that govern the text's **production** or **reception**. For instance, context here would look at when the book was written, or, if it were a different media, what technology was available when the text was made. 

Most often, criticism looks at context in the first way above. The second form of context--understood as the text's mode of production or cultural reception--is quite slippery and ambiguous. While the basic meaning of a text might not change over time, the context of its reception will; this makes examining intent or cultural significance in texts a dicey proposition. Instead, we're better off determining the context of the text itself first, and then taking a look at the context of its reception or mode of production--either now or then--to see if things line up or diverge in interesting ways. 

Below are three ways to think about--and understand--context. Keep these things in mind as you read, or write about, any text:

1. Rely most often on the context set by the text itself rather than outside socio-cultural events or circumstances.Look at how words, settings, characters create context. Do not make assumptions about what the author's intentions might be or the time period in which the text was written. 
2. Look for textual events, characters, settings, that are in conflict with your initial expectations or the context you are expecting to find these things within. 
3. Avoid making assumptions about context if you're looking at parallels between the real world and the represented world (the world of the text)--never assume you fully understand real-world, especially historical contexts. Instead, ask how and why the text might be representing--or commenting upon--a real-world context in an expected or unexpected way. 

Understanding context, and its many nuances, is essential for textual analysis and critical thinking.

**Ballad:**

The ballad is a type of poem that tells a story. Commonly featuring heroes doing heroic deeds, the ballad has a long history in Western poetry as the form most likely to be known to common people. Before printed books and the internet, poems, and especially ballads, were often sung (not everyone could read, even if they could get their hands on the written material). The idea being that poems such as ballads, like catchy pop songs, were easy to remember and the moral, intellectual, cultural, or political ideas the poems conveyed through their stories would have more resonance with the audience--they would remember the poem's ideas better. 

What makes the ballad catchy is the meter--often called "ballad meter." The meter is made up of alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. Or, "taTUM taTUM taTUM taTUM / taTUM taTUM taTUM." There's often some deviation from this basic meter, but if you read the poem out loud you will hear it. And, once you do hear it, you will notice it in many Western songs such as "Amazing Grace." If you read Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" in High School, you know what a ballad looks like. 

---

**Diction:**

Diction generally refers to word choice. We speak to diction when we ask about the words being used--or deployed--in the text. We might ask why a character chooses a particular word or the text itself features a word choice that might suggest a particular effect.

The explicit meaning of a word in the text is often determined by diction and leads us to questions about [[tone]]. 

Be careful not to misunderstand [[tone]] or [[diction]] as an excuse for your ignorance about the cultural context of the text. Reading Shakespeare and finding the language difficult isn't about diction--it simply reflects your lack of familiarity with English during the period in which Shakespeare was writing. 

Diction is not about standalone meaning--use a dictionary to figure that out. Diction is about how and why meaning is attached to that particular word--what is the intention behind the use of *that* word. 

Think about how your diction changes when you write an Email to someone of authority--your boss, the police, a lawyer, versus when you write a friend. You make choices about diction based on the context in which you are writing and your desire to be understood in a certain way. Texts do the same thing! 

---

**Tone:**

Tone generally refers to the "voice" of the text. It signals the attitude or posture of the text--the "feel" of a text. The tone of the text might be optimistic, it might be dark; it might be comedic; it might be cautionary; it might be suspenseful; it might be scary; it might be cynical. 

Tone often requires you to look carefully at the [[diction]] of a text--the words being used and the motivation for those words. When you figure out why certain words are being used, you can often decipher the tone. Do the words gravitate to the optimistic or the pessimistic? Are the words meant to be funny or serious? 

Remember, a text can have a tone, but a [[character]] might have a different tone, or convey a tone, that is in conflict with the tone of the text. The [[setting]] might signal tone as well, but it would do so not in the setting itself--Vancouver, for instance--but in the words the text deploys to describe that setting. Vancouver can be bright and optimistic or dark and pessimistic depending on what words one uses to describe it.  

The conflict between the text's tone, the character's tone, and the setting's tone is one area that creates ambiguity and demands interpretation--why are these conflicts present? What do they mean? How are they working to create meaning? What does the conflict represent? 

Be careful that you do not conflate tone with [[style]]. Style most often refers to the author's preferred approach--or technique. One does not describe the text as "written in an mysterious style"; rather, we might say that the style of the text is a mystery or detective story with a "hard-edged" or "creepy" tone. In short, style should refer to [[form->form and structure]] where tone should refer to feel.

---

**Style:**

Style is most often used to refer to how the text is written. It usually refers to elements of [[form and structure]]. We are addressing style if we speak to sentence structure, or comment on the [[narrative]] and its development or order, describe the text as descriptive, or poetic. Generally, style is a "catch-all" term that needs explanation by referring to specifics of [[diction->diction]] or [[tone->tone]]. Style needs specific examples from the text to be clear--one cannot call a text "poetic" without showing some words or sentences from the text that illustrate "poetic" characteristics.

**Text:**

Text refers to any kind of cultural production that be read or interpreted. Most often, text refers to writing--a book, poem, play, advertisement. That noted, text can also refer to any other form of cultural production: movies, music, painting, sculpture, games, televisions shows, etc. As a result, think of text as anything that can be read or interpreted.

- The way you dress can be read, so you are a kind of text (if you are wearing clothes).
- Classrooms are a kind of text--everything in a classroom signals learning, teaching, reading, writing, attentiveness.

---

**Protagonist:**

The protagonist is the character with whom we are most concerned. The protagonist is also often the driver of the main narrative events--impetus, shifts, inconsistencies, or collisions. We are given usually given access to the inner life of the protagonist, but not always. 

The protagonist is usually juxtaposed with an antagonist--someone (or some thing) that is in conflict with the protagonist. This conflict or opposition could be physical, mental, spiritual, political, cultural, moral, racial, etc.

Protagonists are often very complex, conveying multiple layers, drives, and actions. Sometimes we admire them, but other times we find them unlikable. How we understand or interpret the protagonist depends a lot on what kind of [[character->Character]] s/he represents and the [[context->Context]] in which we see how s/he operates. 

 ---

**Structure:**

Structure refers to the way a text is put into order. Structure is important because it often signals an important element of textual understanding--time. As well, it may indicate the importance of some textual event (or [[symbol->Symbol]] by featuring it more prominently that other events. 

As well, structure can refer to sentence-level mechanics such as [[syntax->Syntax]], [[tone->Tone]], and [[diction->Diction]]. 

We also encounter structure when we think about what the narrator knows about the story being told and her motivations for sequencing the events as she has done. As with every other case, we always need to attend to the words on the page, but structure things about the order of those words, the sequence of the events those words describe 

 ---
 
 **Syntax:**

The order of words in a sentence, and by extension, how words and phrases relate to each other. One way to imagine how syntax works is to imagine how you would represent someone speaking broken English or another native tongue in a way that suggests a lack of familiarity with the language--the way Yoda speaks in *Star Wars* is a classic example of how syntax can impact [[character->Character]]. 

---

**Imagery:**

Imagery refers to the pictures you create in your mind based on your reading of the words on the page. Usually, if you find yourself imagining any of your sense, you are reading imagery. Often, we refer to a specific "image" or repeated [[motif->Motif]] rather than using the term "imagery." 

Imagery is often built up with [[symbol->Symbol]] and [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] such as [[simile->Simile]] and [[metaphor->Metaphor]]. At the same time, other modes of expression such as [[allusion->Allusion]] and [[syntax->Syntax]] can heighten the effect of imagery or an image. 

---

**Character:**

Character refers to the people (maybe animals, houses, robots, or other objects--see [[personification->Personification]] found in the text.  

Characters have different levels of importance, with the main character being the one around whom the story is built or the one shaping the [[narrative->Narrative]]. At the same time, a character or characters will be the anchor for [[point-of-view->Point of View]]. However, any figure who acts, thinks, speaks, or feels is generally a character and can drive the narrative, perhaps hindering the main character, or manipulating the main character. Subordinate characters often have greater [[symbolic->symbol]] roles. 

Briefly, characters can do some or all of the following: 
<ul><li>speak, move, act, think, and feel.</li>
<li>remain invisible as an entity within the story--often as [[omniscient narrators->Omniscient Narrator]]</li>
<li>drive the [[structure->Structure]] of the [[narrative->Narrative]] forward, backward, sideways, or nowhere.</li>
<li>act as a [[symbol->Symbol]] within the text.</li>
<li>act as a signal for [[intertextuality->Intertextuality]] or [[allusion->Allusion]].</li>
<li>reflect common and/or prevailing cultural, political, social, and moral expectations.</li>
<li>speak in a [[syntax->Syntax]] that reflects common and/or prevailing cultural, political, social, and moral expectations.</li>
<li>act as an interpreter of [[symbols->Symbol]] and symbolic meaning in the text--a character who always carries a particular object or dresses a certain way.</li> 
<li>place the [[setting->Setting]] of a text--a text where we read the action in the narrator's head.</li>
<li>act as the template or cornerstone for the text's [[tone->Tone]], [[imagery->Imagery]], or [[motif->Motif]].</li></ul>

---

**Setting:**

Setting is the place where the text takes place. Setting often determines the [[context->Context]] in which we receive meaning in the text. 

There can be more than one setting in a text. In particular, different settings can be found within another setting--a room in a house in Vancouver in Canada. Each of these settings (room, house, Vancouver, Canada) can be approached separately or on their own as having an effect on the [[narrative->Narrative]], [[imagery->Imagery]], or [[symbolism->Symbolism]] of the text. 

Generally, the further away from the setting a [[character->Character]] gets, the less relevant the setting becomes. In the above example, Canada would be a general context, whereas the room would be more personalized the character (or the action of the narrative) and thus more relevant to our interpretation. However, if the character is a [[symbol->Symbol]] of national ideals, prevailing morals, or otherwise, the broader--further away--setting would be relevant to the [[context->Context]] of the text. 

Briefly, the setting can include:

<ul><li>a geographic location--real or imagined. This could be a country, a room, a planet, a library.</li> 
<li>the temporal period in which the text takes place--the past, present, or future (in history, a day, or even a different dimension).</li>
<li>the mental, moral, cultural, social, and emotional environment the characters find themselves in.</li></ul>

When thinking about setting, ask some of the following questions:

<ul><li>Why is the text representing the location?</li> 
<li>Do two settings affect each other, manipulate how we see the other, or offer an opposition to the other?</li>
<li>What about the setting is like other settings--does the setting [[allude->Allusion]] to another place or time (real or imagined)? Is the setting a [[symbol->Symbol]]?</li>
<li>How do characters react to different settings? Do those reactions change in response to a particular setting?</li>
<li>Does the setting change? Why does it change and in response to what? </li></ul>

**Genre:**

Genre refers to the type of [[text->Text]] you are looking at, the expectations governing your reading of it, and the conventions associated with that type of text. Genre often provides [[context->Context]] for understanding a text. 

If we identify a text as a poem, then we read it with particular expectations; we look for rhyme, metre, [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] and other signals that we expect in poetry. When we recognize the genre as a novel, we expect conventions such as [[character->Character]] development, an expanded [[narrative->Narrative]], conflict and resolution over a period of time. More specifically, if we are reading detective fiction, we expect a dead body , an unknown assailant, and a smart detective; if we are reading a romance novel, we expect a love affair often set in an exotic locale. Likewise, advertising, movies, and games are also genres with their own set of conventions. All of the above examples refer to genre. 

Genre is interesting because in setting the context for how we receive a text, it can defy expectations or deploy them in interesting ways. 

Some examples of common genres: mystery, detective fiction, true crime, young adult, epic, [[ballad->Ballad]], romance, science-fiction. As well, genres can be combined: poetic-fantasy, detective-romance.

**Motif:**

Motif refers to a pattern that, throughout the text, creates meaning. Motif usually refers to a repeated [[image->Imagery]], [[character-type->Character]] or [[symbol->Symbol]] that comes to have meaning to some element of the [[text->Text]].  

Motifs can be locked to a text--specific to that text. Or, they can reflect larger cultural, economic, or moral / religious sentiments--we see this most obviously in [[symbols->Symbol]] such as roses and hearts meaning love, crosses meaning religion, white meaning innocence, purity, and cleanliness. 

Motifs are not always symbols. They can be actions as well--the repeated action of running away, or of lighting a cigarette, or drinking a cup of coffee. The important things is that the action (or symbol / image) must be repeated throughout the text, not simply a one-off. If it is a one-off, you're probably better off dealing with it as a [[symbol->Symbol]] or [[image->Image]].

---

**Symbol**

A symbol is something the meaning of which refers to something other than its literal meaning. 

A symbol usually refers to a word, [[image->Image]], or [[motif->Motif]] that represents a larger, more complex idea, [[context->Context]], or image than the literal meaning of the word, image, or motif might represent. For example, the Canadian flag is a symbol for the socio-cultural freedoms the country represents; the beaver is a Canadian symbol meant to suggest both our connection to the land and our work ethic. 

However, the word, image, or motif--the [[signal->Signal]]--for the symbol does not lose its literal meaning. As Gertrude Stein famously wrote: "a rose is a rose is a rose." While symbols are important and have many layers of meaning, it is important to remember that they are also simply words; they can shift over time and reflect something different than they did originally.  

See also: [[character->Character]], [[figurative language->Figurative Language]], [[setting->Setting]].

---

**Signal:**

Signal is a term used to disassociated the literary element from its possible connection to convention. We use signal to indicate something about how the [[image->Image]], [[character->Character]], [[setting->Setting]], [[context->Context]], etc. suggests meaning. 

A character might "signal" a particular [[motif->Motif]]. A [[setting->Setting]] might "signal" a particular context. The [[point-of-view->Point of View]] might "signal" a particular political, ethical, or social belief system. An action might "signal" a hidden meaning or ambiguity in the text's meaning. 

---

**Personification:**

Personification is [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] that gives human traits (qualities, feelings, action, or characteristics) to animals, non-living objects, or ideas (like things, colours, qualities, even abstract ideals).

See also: [[character->Character]]

---

**Metaphor:**

A metaphor is the juxtaposition of two (usually different) things that, when read together, come to mean something different and often provide a heightened [[image--Imagery]] in the mind of the reader. They often describe one thing in terms of another--using [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] to make the two things into one image.

Some examples: 

<ul><li>The boat plows through the water--boats and plows are different, but the image of the boat plowing through the water is vivid when they are put together.</li>
<li>That man is a toad--he's not literally a toad. But, when he is put together with one, we sure get a sense of his [[character->Character]].</li>

Beware the separation of [[simile->Simile]] and metaphor; a simile is a kind of metaphor using like or as. [[Personification->Personification]] is another kind of metaphor.

---

**Simile:**

A simile is a kind of [[metaphor->Metaphor]] that makes a comparison using the words "like" or "as." It is a type of [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] and as such attempts to heighten the impact of language and create a lasting [[image->Image]] or [[symbol->Symbol]].











---

**Point-of-View:**

Point-of-View
Definition:

In the wise words of Oscar Wilde, "The optimist sees the doughnut; the pessimist the hole."

Tossing the doughnuts aside for a moment (what? never!), we'd like to point out what Oscar is in fact pointing out: perspective is important.

And that's where point of view comes in. Point of view is the perspective of a narrator or character. A narrator can write from different points of view, mainly first person or third person.

Choosing the point of view is a big deal for an author, because the perspective from which a novel is narrated has a big impact on a reader's experience. If it's in the first person, for example, we get a limited view of the events; we don't get the full picture, but we do get to get to know a character quite well. If we're reading from a third person's perspective, we might get a bird's eye view, but we'll be a bit detached from the goings on.

Of course, these are generalizations, and the effect of point of view is different for each book you read. But it's always something to consider.

---

**Narrative:**

Human nature
Owen Flanagan of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."[6] Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the humanities involve stories.[7] Stories are of ancient origin, existing in ancient Egyptian, ancient Greek, Chinese and Indian cultures and their myths. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as parables and examples to illustrate points. Storytelling was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and meaning-making.

Semiotics begins with the individual building blocks of meaning called signs; and semantics, the way in which signs are combined into codes to transmit messages. This is part of a general communication system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different modalities and forms.

In On Realism in Art Roman Jakobson argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors encode their texts with distinctive literary qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in Russian Formalism through Victor Shklovsky's analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of Vladimir Propp, who analysed the plots used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.[8] This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the Prague School and of French scholars such as Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important epistemological questions:

What is text?
What is its role (culture)?
How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
Why is narrative divided into different genres, such as poetry, short stories, and novels?
Literary theory
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as fiction-writing mode in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, literary criticism as an academic exercise dealt solely with poetry (including epic poems like the Iliad and Paradise Lost, and poetic drama like Shakespeare). Most poems did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But novels, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the 18th century, the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.[according to whom?]

Types of narrators and their modes
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between first-person and third-person narrative, which Gérard Genette refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called narrative modes): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a first-person narrator brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a third-person limited narrator is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a third-person omniscient narrator gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

Multiple narrators
Main article: Multiperspectivity
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of Louise Erdrich. William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs stream of consciousness to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.[9]

Aesthetics approach
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of narrative structure, with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" (David Lodge The Art of Fiction 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge The Art of Fiction 97; see also the theory of Mikhail Bakhtin for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see Reader Response theory); communicates with a Wayne Booth-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see Hayden White, Metahistory for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward bildungsroman, a description of identity development with an effort to evince becoming in character and community.[jargon]

Psychological approach
See also: Narrative therapy
Within philosophy of mind, the social sciences and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.[10] A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of personal or cultural identity, and in the creation and construction of memories; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the self.[11][12] The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of psychosis and mental disorder, and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of recovery.[13] Narrative Therapy is a school of (family) psychotherapy.

**Narrative Structure:**

Definition
Narrative structure is about story and plot: the content of a story and the form used to tell the story. Story refers to the dramatic action as it might be described in chronological order. Plot refers to how the story is told. Story is about trying to determine the key conflicts, main characters, setting and events. Plot is about how, and at what stages, the key conflicts are set up and resolved.[1]

Description
The setup (act one) is where all of the main characters and their basic situations are introduced, and contains the primary level of characterization (exploring the character's backgrounds and personalities). A problem is also introduced, which is what drives the story forward.

The second act, the conflict, is the bulk of the story, and begins when the inciting incident (or catalyst) sets things into motion. This is the part of the story where the characters go through major changes in their lives as a result of what is happening; this can be referred to as the character arc, or character development.

The third act, or resolution, is when the problem in the story boils over, forcing the characters to confront it, allowing all the elements of the story to come together and inevitably leading to the ending.

History
First described in ancient times by Greek philosophers (such as Aristotle and Plato), the notion of narrative structure saw renewed popularity as a critical concept in the mid-to-late-20th century, when structuralist literary theorists including Roland Barthes, Vladimir Propp, Joseph Campbell, and Northrop Frye attempted to argue that all human narratives have certain universal, deep structural elements in common. This argument fell out of fashion when advocates of poststructuralism such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida asserted that such universally shared, deep structures were logically impossible.

In Frye's Anatomy of Criticism, he deals extensively with what he calls myths of Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter:

Spring myths are comedies, that is, stories that lead from bad situations to happy endings. Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is such a story.
Summer myths are similarly utopian fantasies such as Dante's Paradiso.
Fall myths are tragedies that lead from ideal situations to disaster. Compare Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear and the movie Legends of the Fall.
Winter myths are dystopias; for example, George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ayn Rand's novella Anthem.
Categories
Most forms of narrative fall under four main categories: linear narratives, nonlinear narrative, interactive narration, and interactive narrative.

Linear narrative is the most common form of narration, where events are largely portrayed in a chronological order, that is, telling the events in the order in which they occurred.
Nonlinear narratives, disjointed narrative or disrupted narrative is a narrative technique, where events are portrayed, out of chronological order or in other ways where the narrative does not follow the direct causality pattern.
Interactive narration refers to works where the linear narrative is driven by, rather than influenced by, the users interaction.
Interactive narrative is a form of fiction in which users are able to make choices that influence the narrative (for example, through alternative plots or resulting in alternative endings) through their actions.
Linear narrative
Flashbacks are often confused with true narratives which are not linear, but the concept is fundamentally linear. An example would be Citizen Kane by Orson Welles. Although some films appear to open (very briefly) with the ending, flashback movies almost immediately jump back to the very beginning of the story to proceed linearly from there, and usually proceed past the supposed "ending" shown at the beginning of the movie.

Nonlinear narrative
Cinema can only provide the illusion through broken narrative, a famous example of this being the 1994 film Pulp Fiction. The film is ostensibly three short stories, which, upon closer inspection, are actually three sections of one story with the chronology broken up; Quentin Tarantino constructs the narrative without resorting to classic "flashback" techniques.

An even more ambitious attempt at constructing a film based on non-linear narrative is Alain Resnais's 1993 French film Smoking/No Smoking. The plot contains parallel developments, playing on the idea of what might have happened had the characters made different choices.

Interactive narration
In works of interactive narration there is only one narrative but the method of delivery requires the user to actively work to gain the next piece of the narrative, or have to piece the parts of narrative that they have together in order to form a coherent narrative.

This is the narrative approach of some modern video games. A player will be required to reach an objective, complete a task, solve a puzzle, or finish a level before the narrative continues.

Interactive narrative
An interactive narrative is one which is composed with a branching structure where a single starting point may lead to multiple developments and outcomes. The principle of all such games is that, at each step of the narrative, the user makes choices that advance the story, leading to new series of choices. Authoring non-linear narrative or dialogue thus implies imagining an indefinite number of parallel stories.

In a gamebook, readers are told to turn to a certain page according to the choice they wish to make to continue the story. Typically, the choice will be an action rather than dialogue. For example, the hero hears a noise in another room and must decide to open the door and investigate, run away, or call for help. This kind of interactive experience of a story is possible with video games and books (where the reader is free to turn the pages) but less adapted to other forms of entertainment. Improvisational theatre is similarly open-ended, but of course cannot be said to be authored.

**First-Person Narrative Voice:**

First-person Narration
Definition:

When the story you're reading is from the point-of-view of a character in the novel (often the protagonist), you're reading first-person narration. First-person narrators make frequent use of the pronoun "I," because, you know, they're talking about themselves, or at the very least what's going on around them. This style of narration gives us insight into a character's thoughts and feelings. Lucky us.

If you're looking for some of the more famous first-person narrators in all of literature, look no further than Scout in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, or that phony-calling phony, Holden Caulfield, in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye.

First-person narration sounds nice and simple, right? You've got an "I" and he's doing some talking. Moving on. But there are actually a ton of different ways that first-person narration can play out. Examples? Oh, we've got those in spades:

There's the interior monologue of the Underground Man in Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground.
There's the dramatic monologue of Jean-Baptiste in Albert Camus's The Fall. 
There's even the strange, plural first-person narration in Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily."
Oh, and speaking of Faulkner, he had three (count 'em!) first-person narrators in The Sound and the Fury, who trade off telling their stories. Then he even tosses a third-person narrator our way at the end, just for kicks.
Faulkner was a sneaky guy, and he found his way around the limitations of first-person narration. But there are other tricks authors use, too, like, say, a peripheral narrator.

A peripheral narrator is a first-person narrator who's not the main character. She gets to give us the lowdown on the juicy dealings of the true protagonists and antagonists, all while watching from a safe distance. Think Nick Carraway in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.

But we can get even further removed than Nick, if we really want to. The narrator of Joseph Conrad's most famous novel, Heart of Darkness is telling us a story he heard from a guy named Marlow, who's telling the story of yet another guy named Kurtz. You might have heard of him. He dead.

See, not so simple after all, huh? It's important to remember that the first-person narrative style can open up a lot of doors for the author, but it slams some other doors right in his face. On the one hand, he can give the readers VIP access into his character's thoughts and feelings, and that's just what we hungry readers are craving, right? But on the other hand, he can't just zoom out and suddenly see things going on in multiple places at once, like a third-person narrator can.

It's also super important to remember that when a first-person is narrating the story, they're somehow involved in the whole shebang. They're part of the action. They've got something at stake. Unfortunately, this means that they're not always the most trustworthy of folks. They're not always interested in full disclosure.

When we can't trust our narrator, we call them unreliable, and we don't just mean that they bail on plans. Although frankly, if Nick Carraway didn't show up to our Roaring '20s party, we'd be pretty peeved. For a classic example of an unreliable narrator, take a look at our take on Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart." Or really any of Poe's narrators for that matter. They were notoriously flaky.

**Third-Person Narrative Voice:**

Third-person Narration
Definition:

You'll find third-person narration in stories where a detached person (someone who isn't directly involved in the action) tells you everything that goes down. A third-person narrator can sometimes be omniscient, when they have a bird's-eye-view of all the goings on. Or they can be limited, and stick closely to the perspectives of just one or two characters.

The bonus of having a third-person narrator is that we readers aren't trapped inside one character's head. We might gain access to the thoughts and feelings of other characters, and we might get to see what goes down in two different places at the same time. It's a nice dose of perspective that allows us readers to evaluate what's going on with as little bias as possible. 

But there are drawbacks, too. For one thing, it can be tougher to sympathize with characters when an author is using third-person narration (particularly when it's omniscient), because the narration is so detached from what's going on in the hearts and minds of the folks on the ground. Hey, sometimes we want a little bias, okay?

**Omniscient Narrative Voice:**

Omniscience
Definition:

A word usually used in relation to narrators, omniscience means all-knowingness. If a narrator is omniscient, he or she has the god-like ability to see and know everything going on in the world of the novel, the lucky duck. Omniscience is often a feature of third-person narration, which makes sense, because it would be awfully hard for a first-person narrator to read the minds of the characters around her.

Want to see an omniscient narrator in all their awesome, knowledgey glory? Meet the narrator of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. He knows what's up.

**Narrator:**

Narrator
Definition:

The narrator is the one who tells the story—kind of like a guide leading you through a novel or short story. A narrator can have a limited point-of-view, as with first-person narrators, or they can have total omniscience. Narrators can be unreliable or trustworthy. They can be close to the action or as far away as possible. It all depends.

In many ways, narrators (even third-person ones) become characters in their own right. Some of our favorite narrators include Watson in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the witty, snarky voice of Jane Austen's novels, and the kooky narrator of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Who are your faves?

**Allusion:**

Let's get down to brass tacks. An allusion is, plain and simple, a reference. You'll find allusions (or shout-outs, as we like to call them) when the book you're reading makes a reference to something outside of itself, whether another work of literature, something from pop culture, a song, myth, history, or even the visual arts.

Why use allusions? Because they connect literature to other pieces of literature (or art or music or history or whatever). Allusions deepen and enrich a work's meaning, and are a form of intertextuality, so they help books talk to each other.

Examples? William Shakespeare is the king of being alluded to and referenced in literature. The title of William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury is an allusion to a line from Macbeth, and when we read Faulkner, if we keep Macbeth in mind, Faulkner's meaning just might be enhanced.

Oh, and the title of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest is an allusion to Hamlet's description of Yorick in Hamlet.

**Intertextuality:**

Intertextuality
Definition:

People have conversations with each other, so why can't books?

Intertextuality is a conversation between books. Intertextual books reference other pieces of writing, and use those references to make meaning. Have a look at our discussion of intertextuality in Rebecca Stead's When You Reach Me for more.

But intertextuality isn't just for books, so keep a weather eye out for it when you're watching your next episode of Community.

**Figure of Speech:**

Figure of speech is a catch-all phrase that refers to the literary devices used in figurative language. Called tropes by some folks, figures of speech take meaning to another level (to the figurative, beyond the literal), and come in all shapes and sizes. Figures of speech include metaphors, similes, and personification.

In our everyday conversations, we often use "figure of speech" to refer to a common metaphor that everyone understands. So when you tell your mother that you love her to death and she looks horrified, you can say, "Aw, it's okay, Ma. That's just a figure of speech." But then again, she probably already knew that.
