1102.006 / 007: Reading Literature and Culture: The Archive

Hybrid Delivery - These sections are offered in a hybrid format: the class meets two hours per week and students complete the remaining class requirements online.


In this course, we will examine artistic (primarily literary) representations of the archive. We'll look at how texts portray history, memory, and popular culture through stories about archives, libraries, bookstores, and digital records. We'll focus on how themes, symbols, and characters encounter archives, both real and imagined. On the whole, the course will address how representations of the archive might reveal inherent biases about race, gender, and cultural production while at the same time providing context for coping with the increasing volume of our own digital production, personal archives, and social records. 

Probable Texts:

Cooley, Martha: *The Archivist*
