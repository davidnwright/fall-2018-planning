1130 and 1102 Think

Maybe divide 1130 into five categories from which students can choose their own direction:

1. Canadian Indigenous Reconciliation and Identity
2. Urban Renewal Plan for Your Neighbourhood
3. Sports and Economic Status
4. The Immigrant Experience
5. Resistance and Protest

MAKE A SHEET FOR THIS:

Every four weeks, everyone briefs (gives updates) everyone else about what they are doing... attendance at these briefings are mandatory. Roughly 650 words each, answering the questions below:

- current title of your research project
- list the five current key terms governing your research
- a thesis statement
- a central question that you are asking about your topic
- an answer to your question
- a bibliography of five books / articles / websites / magazines / media that you have consulted
- a minimum 350-word discussion of your research / creative process, failures, current thinking, etc.


So now is this [markdown](markdown.com) ready? 



- *The Things They Carried* as a short story
- "Casey at the Bat" as the first poem we read
