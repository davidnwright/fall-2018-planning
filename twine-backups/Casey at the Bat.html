Here&#x27;s the definition of [[figurative language-&gt;Figurative Language]]: Figurative language uses figures of speech to be more effective, persuasive, and impactful. Figures of speech such as metaphors, similes, and allusions go beyond the literal meanings of the words to give readers new insights. On the other hand, alliterations, imageries, or onomatopoeias are figurative devices that appeal to the senses of the readers.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Figurative Language" tags="key-terms" position="39.999999999999886,588.3333333333333">Figurative language uses [[metaphor--&gt;Metaphor]], [[simile-&gt;Simile]], and [[allusion-&gt;Allusion]] to project beyond the literal meanings of words. Sometimes, we call this kind of language &quot;figure of speech&quot; because it is often used in the non-literal sense for rhetorical or vivid effect.

When we encounter a metaphor such as &quot;The boat plaows through the water,&quot; we do not imagine a literal boat and a literal plow. Instead, we see the [[symbolic-&gt;Symbol]], or non-literal aspects of the boat (imagining it moving through water) and the plow (imagining it moving through the field). The collision between these two things (a boat from the water and a plow from the land) creates a vivid [[image-&gt;Imagery]] of //how// the boat is moving through the water. As a counterpoint, imagine a boat //flying// through the water. The boat is not literally flying; it is moving quickly.

by Ernest Lawrence Thayer

The outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.

A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought, “If only Casey could but get a whack at that--
We’d put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.”

But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.

But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
And Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.

Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.

There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place;
There was pride in Casey’s bearing and a smile lit Casey’s face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
No stranger in the crowd could doubt ‘twas Casey at the bat.

Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his
     shirt;
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
Defiance flashed in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip.

And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the
     air,
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
“That ain’t my style,&quot; said Casey. “Strike one!” the umpire said.

From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled
     roar,
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;
“Kill him! Kill the umpire!” shouted someone on the stand;
And it’s likely they’d have killed him had not Casey raised his

With a smile of Christian charity great Casey’s visage shone;

The sneer is gone from Casey’s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey’s blow.

Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children
     shout,
But there is no joy in Mudville--mighty Casey has struck out.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Alliteration" tags="key-terms" position="488.33333333333326,470.00000000000006">Alliteration is a stylistic device in which a number of words, having the same first consonant sound, occur close together in a series.

For example:

- But a better butter makes a batter better.
- A big bully beats a baby boy.

Both sentences above are alliterative because the same first letter of words (B) occurs close together and produces alliteration in the sentence. An important point to remember here is that alliteration does not depend on letters but on sounds. So the phrase &quot;not knotty&quot; is alliterative, but &quot;cigarette chase&quot; is not.

Other common examples of alliteration:

- PayPal
- Best Buy
- Coca-Cola
- Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Hyperbole" tags="figurative-language" position="455.9999999999999,236.66666666666669">Pronounced &quot;Hi-Per-Bowl-E&quot;, Hyperbole is a device often employed in our day-to-day speech. You might meet a friend after a long time and say, “It’s been ages since I last saw you.” You may not have met her recently, but the use of the word “ages” exaggerates this statement to add emphasis to your wait. 

Hyperbole is a form of [[figurative language-&gt;Figurative Language]] to create [[symbolism-&gt;Symbol]] or heighten the [[imagery-&gt;Imagery]] of a text. 

Hyperbole is an unreal exaggeration to emphasize the real situation, such as when we might say &quot;My grandmother is as old as the hills,&quot; &quot;your suitcase weighs a ton!&quot; or &quot;I am trying to solve a million issues these days&quot;

It is important not to confuse hyperbole with [[simile-&gt;Simile]] and [[metaphor-&gt;Metaphor]]. It does make a comparison, like simile and metaphor, but hyperbole has a humorous effect created by an overstatement--he was in such a hurry that he drove his car at a bazillion miles per hour.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Context" tags="key-terms" position="1191.6666666666667,138.33333333333326">**Context:**

Context refers to the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. Another way of understanding context is to state that it is the situation within which we understand something. Precisely, context refers to the parts of something written or spoken that immediately precede and follow a word or passage and *clarify its meaning*.

Context has a lot to do with our expectations--particularly thematic and cultural expectations. When we go to an Italian restaurant, we do not expect to see Chinese food on the menu--that would be *out* of context. When things are *in context*, we get what we expect--Italian food at an Italian restaurant. Likewise, if we are going to a &quot;family restaurant,&quot; we do not expect haute cuisine or expensive dishes on the menu. Instead, we expect choice, stuff for kids, and reasonable prices--options. Context helps us determine the meaning of the food and governs our expectations. When I order a hamburger at a fancy restaurant, I expect an expensive, fancy, hamburger. When I go to a fast food restaurant, I do not expect an expensive, fancy, hamburger. The context determines how I &quot;receive&quot; the information of the hamburger.    

When we speak to context in textual analysis, or make it relevant to our reading, context is two-fold:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&#x27;s the context of the words on the page, the context shaped by the [[&#x27;&#x27;text&#x27;&#x27;-&gt;Text]]--the framework for understanding descriptions, motivations, activities, words, places and their role(s) in the text--and how context shapes the meaning of those things. For example, we understand that Casey is a baseball player--and a very good hitter normally--in &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; because that&#x27;s what the poem shows us is the context for receiving Casey.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;There&#x27;s the context into which the **item or thing** belongs--the cultural, social, political, racial or other contexts that govern the text&#x27;s **production** or **reception**. For instance, context here would look at when the book was written, or, if it were a different media, what technology was available when the text was made.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; 
Most often, criticism looks at context in the first way above. The second form of context--understood as the text&#x27;s mode of production or cultural reception--is quite slippery and ambiguous. While the basic meaning of a text might not change over time, the context of its reception will; this makes examining intent or cultural significance in texts a dicey proposition. Instead, we&#x27;re better off determining the context of the text itself first, and then taking a look at the context of its reception or mode of production--either now or then--to see if things line up or diverge in interesting ways. 

Below are three ways to think about--and understand--context. Keep these things in mind as you read, or write about, any text:

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rely most often on the context set by the text itself rather than outside socio-cultural events or circumstances.Look at how words, settings, characters create context. Do not make assumptions about what the author&#x27;s intentions might be or the time period in which the text was written.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Look for textual events, characters, settings, that are in conflict with your initial expectations or the context you are expecting to find these things within.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Avoid making assumptions about context if you&#x27;re looking at parallels between the real world and the represented world (the world of the text)--never assume you fully understand real-world, especially historical contexts. Instead, ask how and why the text might be representing--or commenting upon--a real-world context in an expected or unexpected way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Understanding context, and its many nuances, is essential for textual analysis and critical thinking.

The ballad is a type of poem that tells a story. Commonly featuring heroes doing heroic deeds, the ballad has a long history in Western poetry as the form most likely to be known to common people. Before printed books and the internet, poems, and especially ballads, were often sung (not everyone could read, even if they could get their hands on the written material). The idea being that poems such as ballads, like catchy pop songs, were easy to remember and the moral, intellectual, cultural, or political ideas the poems conveyed through their stories would have more resonance with the audience--they would remember the poem&#x27;s ideas / morals better. 

What makes the ballad catchy is the meter--often called &quot;ballad meter.&quot; The meter is made up of alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. Or, &quot;taTUM taTUM taTUM taTUM / taTUM taTUM taTUM.&quot; There&#x27;s often some deviation from this basic meter, but if you read the poem out loud you will hear it. And, once you do hear it, you will notice it in many Western songs such as &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot; If you know Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; from High School, you know what a ballad looks like.

Text refers to any kind of cultural production that be read or interpreted. Most often, text refers to writing--a book, poem, play, advertisement. That noted, text can also refer to any other form of cultural production: movies, music, painting, sculpture, games, televisions shows, etc. As a result, think of text as anything that can be read or interpreted.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The way you dress can be read, so you are a kind of text (if you are wearing clothes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classrooms are a kind of text--everything in a classroom signals learning, teaching, reading, writing, attentiveness.&lt;/li&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Diction" tags="key-terms" position="590,225">&#x27;&#x27;Diction:&#x27;&#x27;

Diction generally refers to word choice. We speak to diction when we ask about the words being used--or deployed--in the text. We might ask why a character chooses a particular word or the text itself features a word choice that might suggest a particular effect.

The explicit meaning of a word in the text is often determined by diction and leads us to questions about [[tone-&gt;Tone]]. 

Be careful not to misunderstand tone or diction as an excuse for your ignorance about the cultural context of the text. Reading Shakespeare and finding the language difficult isn&#x27;t about diction--it simply reflects your lack of familiarity with English during the period in which Shakespeare was writing. 

Diction is not about standalone meaning--use a dictionary to figure that out. Diction is about how and why meaning is attached to that particular word--what is the intention behind the use of *that* word. 

Think about how your diction changes when you write an Email to someone of authority--your boss, the police, a lawyer, versus when you write a friend. You make choices about diction based on the context in which you are writing and your desire to be understood in a certain way. Texts do the same thing! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Tone" tags="key-terms" position="911.666666666667,441.6666666666667">**Tone:**

Tone generally refers to the &quot;voice&quot; of the text. It signals the attitude or posture of the text--the &quot;feel&quot; of a text. The tone of the text might be optimistic, it might be dark; it might be comedic; it might be cautionary; it might be suspenseful; it might be scary; it might be cynical. 

Tone often requires you to look carefully at the [[diction-&gt;Diction]] of a text--the words being used and the motivation for those words. When you figure out why certain words are being used, you can often decipher the tone. Do the words gravitate to the optimistic or the pessimistic? Are the words meant to be funny or serious? 

Remember, a text can have a tone, but a [[character-&gt;Character]] might have a different tone, or convey a tone, that is in conflict with the tone of the text. The [[setting-&gt;Setting]] might signal tone as well, but it would do so not in the setting itself--Vancouver, for instance--but in the words the text deploys to describe that setting. Vancouver can be bright and optimistic or dark and pessimistic depending on what words one uses to describe it.  

The conflict between the text&#x27;s tone, the character&#x27;s tone, and the setting&#x27;s tone is one area that creates ambiguity and demands interpretation--why are these conflicts present? What do they mean? How are they working to create meaning? What does the conflict represent? 

Be careful that you do not conflate tone with [[style-&gt;Style]]. Style most often refers to the author&#x27;s preferred approach--or technique. One does not describe the text as &quot;written in an mysterious style&quot;; rather, we might say that the style of the text is a mystery or detective story with a &quot;hard-edged&quot; or &quot;creepy&quot; tone. In short, style should refer to [[structure-&gt;Structure]] where tone should refer to feel.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Character" tags="key-terms" position="1010,211.66666666666669">**Character:**

Character refers to the people (maybe animals, houses, robots, or other objects--see [[personification-&gt;Personification]] found in the text.  

Characters have different levels of importance, with the main character being the one around whom the story is built or the one shaping the [[narrative-&gt;Narrative]]. At the same time, a character or characters will be the anchor for [[point-of-view-&gt;Point of View]]. However, any figure who acts, thinks, speaks, or feels is generally a character and can drive the narrative, perhaps hindering the main character, or manipulating the main character. Subordinate characters often have greater [[symbolic-&gt;Symbol]] roles. 

Briefly, characters can do some or all of the following: 
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;speak, move, act, think, and feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remain invisible as an entity within the story--often as [[omniscient narrators-&gt;Omniscient Narrator]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;drive the [[structure-&gt;Structure]] of the [[narrative-&gt;Narrative]] forward, backward, sideways, or nowhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act as a [[symbol-&gt;Symbol]] within the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act as a signal for [[intertextuality-&gt;Intertextuality]] or [[allusion-&gt;Allusion]].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reflect common and/or prevailing cultural, political, social, and moral expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speak in a [[syntax-&gt;Syntax]] that reflects common and/or prevailing cultural, political, social, and moral expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act as an interpreter of [[symbols-&gt;Symbol]] and symbolic meaning in the text--a character who always carries a particular object or dresses a certain way.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;place the [[setting-&gt;Setting]] of a text--a text where we read the action in the narrator&#x27;s head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act as the template or cornerstone for the text&#x27;s [[tone-&gt;Tone]], [[imagery-&gt;Imagery]], or [[motif-&gt;Motif]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Setting" tags="key-terms" position="1538.3333333333333,263.33333333333326">**Setting:**

Setting is the place where the text takes place. Setting often determines the [[context-&gt;Context]] in which we receive meaning in the text. 

There can be more than one setting in a text. In particular, different settings can be found within another setting--a room in a house in Vancouver in Canada. Each of these settings (room, house, Vancouver, Canada) can be approached separately or on their own as having an effect on the [[narrative-&gt;Narrative]], [[imagery-&gt;Imagery]], or [[symbolism-&gt;Symbol]] of the text. 

Generally, the further away from the setting a [[character-&gt;Character]] gets, the less relevant the setting becomes. In the above example, Canada would be a general context, whereas the room would be more personalized the character (or the action of the narrative) and thus more relevant to our interpretation. However, if the character is a [[symbol-&gt;Symbol]] of national ideals, prevailing morals, or otherwise, the broader--further away--setting would be relevant to the [[context-&gt;Context]] of the text. 

Briefly, the setting can include:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a geographic location--real or imagined. This could be a country, a room, a planet, a library.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;the temporal period in which the text takes place--the past, present, or future (in history, a day, or even a different dimension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mental, moral, cultural, social, and emotional environment the characters find themselves in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

When thinking about setting, ask some of the following questions:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is the text representing the location?&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Do two settings affect each other, manipulate how we see the other, or offer an opposition to the other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about the setting is like other settings--does the setting [[allude-&gt;Allusion]] to another place or time (real or imagined)? Is the setting a [[symbol-&gt;Symbol]]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do characters react to different settings? Do those reactions change in response to a particular setting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the setting change? Why does it change and in response to what? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Style" tags="key-terms" position="284.99999999999994,386.66666666666674">&#x27;&#x27;Style:&#x27;&#x27;

Style is most often used to refer to //how// the text is written. It usually refers to elements of [[form and structure-&gt;Structure]]. 

We are addressing style if we speak to sentence structure, [[figurative language-&gt;Figurative Language]], or comment on the [[narrative-&gt;Narrative]] development and its [[form and structure-&gt;Structure]], or describe the text as descriptive, or poetic. 

Generally, style is a &quot;catch-all&quot; term that needs explanation by referring to specifics of [[diction-&gt;Diction]] or [[tone-&gt;Tone]]. Style needs specific examples from the text to be clear--one cannot call a text &quot;poetic&quot; without showing some words or sentences from the text that illustrate &quot;poetic&quot; characteristics. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Structure" tags="key-terms" position="1235.0000000000005,655">**Structure:**

Structure refers to the way a text is put into order. Structure is important because it often signals an important element of textual understanding--time. As well, it may indicate the importance of some textual event (or [[symbol-&gt;Symbol]] by featuring it more prominently that other events. 

As well, structure can refer to sentence-level mechanics such as [[syntax-&gt;Syntax]], [[tone-&gt;Tone]], and [[diction-&gt;Diction]]. 

We also encounter structure when we think about what the narrator knows about the story being told and her motivations for sequencing the events as she has done. As with every other case, we always need to attend to the words on the page, but structure things about the order of those words, the sequence of the events those words describe.  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Narrative" tags="" position="1063.3333333333333,475">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Point of View" tags="" position="1316.666666666667,138.3333333333332">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Protagonist" tags="key-terms" position="1215,326.6666666666666">**Protagonist:**

The protagonist is the [[character-&gt;Character]] with whom we are most concerned. The protagonist is also often the driver of the main [[narrative-&gt;Narrative]] events--impetus, shifts, inconsistencies, or collisions--and sometims determines the [[point-of-view-&gt;Point of View]] in which we encounter the text. We are given usually given access to the inner life of the protagonist, but not always. 

The protagonist is usually juxtaposed with an antagonist--someone (or some thing) that is in conflict with the protagonist. This conflict or opposition could be physical, mental, spiritual, political, cultural, moral, racial, etc.

Protagonists are often very complex, conveying multiple layers, drives, and actions. Sometimes we admire them, but other times we find them unlikable. 

How we understand or interpret the protagonist depends a lot on what kind of [[character-&gt;Character]] s/he represents and the [[context-&gt;Context]] in which we see how s/he operates. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Syntax" tags="key-terms" position="1493.3333333333333,663.3333333333333">**Syntax:**

The order of words in a sentence, and by extension, how words and phrases relate to each other. One way to imagine how syntax works is to imagine how you would represent someone speaking broken English or another native tongue in a way that suggests a lack of familiarity with the language--the way Yoda speaks in *Star Wars* is a classic example of how syntax can impact [[character-&gt;Character]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Symbol" tags="" position="781.666666666667,721.6666666666666">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Imagery" tags="key-terms" position="748.3333333333334,233.33333333333331">**Imagery:**

Imagery refers to the pictures you create in your mind based on your reading of the words on the page. Usually, if you find yourself imagining any of your sense, you are reading imagery. Often, we refer to a specific &quot;image&quot; or repeated [[motif-&gt;Motif]] rather than using the term &quot;imagery.&quot; 

Imagery is often built up with [[symbol-&gt;Symbol]] and [[figurative language-&gt;Figurative Language]] such as [[simile-&gt;Simile]] and [[metaphor-&gt;Metaphor]]. At the same time, other modes of expression such as [[allusion-&gt;Allusion]], [[intertextuality-&gt;Intertextuality]], and [[syntax-&gt;Syntax]] can heighten the effect of imagery or an image. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Motif" tags="" position="441.66666666666674,685">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="Simile" tags="" position="646.6666666666667,730">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Metaphor" tags="" position="1048.3333333333335,721.6666666666667">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Allusion" tags="" position="1263.3333333333335,783.3333333333334">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Intertextuality" tags="" position="921.6666666666667,715">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Personification" tags="key-terms" position="294.9999999999999,231.66666666666666">**Personification:**

Personification is [[figurative language-&gt;Figurative Language]] that gives human traits (qualities, feelings, action, or characteristics) to animals, non-living objects, or ideas (like things, colours, qualities, even abstract ideals).
