**Figurative Language:**

Figurative language uses [[metaphor->Metaphor]], [[simile->Simile]], and [[allusion->Allusion]] to project beyond the literal meanings of words, usally to convey an [[image->Image]]. Sometimes, we call this kind of language "figure of speech" because it is often used in the non-literal sense for rhetorical or vivid effect.

When we encounter a metaphor such as "The boat plows through the water," we do not imagine a literal boat and a literal plow. Instead, we see the [[symbolic->Symbol]], or non-literal aspects of the boat (imagining it moving through water) and the plow (imagining it moving through the field). The collision between these two things (a boat from the water and a plow from the land) creates a vivid [[image->Imagery]] of //how// the boat is moving through the water. As a counterpoint, imagine a boat //flying// through the water. The boat is not literally flying; it is moving quickly.

**Text:**

Text refers to any kind of cultural production that be read or interpreted. Most often, text refers to writing--a book, poem, play, advertisement. That noted, text can also refer to any other form of cultural production: movies, music, painting, sculpture, games, televisions shows, etc. As a result, think of text as anything that can be read or interpreted.

- The way you dress can be read, so you are a kind of text (if you are wearing clothes).
- Classrooms are a kind of text--everything in a classroom signals learning, teaching, reading, writing, attentiveness.

**Context:**

Context refers to the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. Another way of understanding context is to state that it is the situation within which we understand something. Precisely, context refers to the parts of something written or spoken that immediately precede and follow a word or passage and *clarify its meaning*.

Context has a lot to do with our expectations--particularly thematic and cultural expectations. When we go to an Italian restaurant, we do not expect to see Chinese food on the menu--that would be *out* of context. When things are *in context*, we get what we expect--Italian food at an Italian restaurant. Likewise, if we are going to a "family restaurant," we do not expect haute cuisine or expensive dishes on the menu. Instead, we expect choice, stuff for kids, and reasonable prices--options. Context helps us determine the meaning of the food and governs our expectations. When I order a hamburger at a fancy restaurant, I expect an expensive, fancy, hamburger. When I go to a fast food restaurant, I do not expect an expensive, fancy, hamburger. The context determines how I "receive" the information of the hamburger.    

When we speak to context in textual analysis, or make it relevant to our reading, context is two-fold:

1.  There's the context of the words on the page, the context shaped by the **text**--the framework for understanding descriptions, motivations, activities, words, places and their role(s) in the text--and how context shapes the meaning of those things. For example, we understand that Casey is a baseball player--and a very good hitter normally--in "Casey at the Bat" because that's what the poem shows us is the context for receiving Casey. 
2. There's the context into which the **item or thing** belongs--the cultural, social, political, racial or other contexts that govern the text's **production** or **reception**. For instance, context here would look at when the book was written, or, if it were a different media, what technology was available when the text was made. 

Most often, criticism looks at context in the first way above. The second form of context--understood as the text's mode of production or cultural reception--is quite slippery and ambiguous. While the basic meaning of a text might not change over time, the context of its reception will; this makes examining intent or cultural significance in texts a dicey proposition. Instead, we're better off determining the context of the text itself first, and then taking a look at the context of its reception or mode of production--either now or then--to see if things line up or diverge in interesting ways. 

Below are three ways to think about--and understand--context. Keep these things in mind as you read, or write about, any text:

1. Rely most often on the context set by the text itself rather than outside socio-cultural events or circumstances.Look at how words, settings, characters create context. Do not make assumptions about what the author's intentions might be or the time period in which the text was written. 
2. Look for textual events, characters, settings, that are in conflict with your initial expectations or the context you are expecting to find these things within. 
3. Avoid making assumptions about context if you're looking at parallels between the real world and the represented world (the world of the text)--never assume you fully understand real-world, especially historical contexts. Instead, ask how and why the text might be representing--or commenting upon--a real-world context in an expected or unexpected way. 

Understanding context, and its many nuances, is essential for textual analysis and critical thinking.

**Ballad:**

The ballad is a type of poem that tells a story. Commonly featuring heroes doing heroic deeds, the ballad has a long history in Western poetry as the form most likely to be known to common people. Before printed books and the internet, poems, and especially ballads, were often sung (not everyone could read, even if they could get their hands on the written material). The idea being that poems such as ballads, like catchy pop songs, were easy to remember and the moral, intellectual, cultural, or political ideas the poems conveyed through their stories would have more resonance with the audience--they would remember the poem's ideas better. 

What makes the ballad catchy is the meter--often called "ballad meter." The meter is made up of alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter. Or, "taTUM taTUM taTUM taTUM / taTUM taTUM taTUM." There's often some deviation from this basic meter, but if you read the poem out loud you will hear it. And, once you do hear it, you will notice it in many Western songs such as "Amazing Grace." If you read Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" in High School, you know what a ballad looks like. 

---

**Diction:**

Diction generally refers to word choice. We speak to diction when we ask about the words being used--or deployed--in the text. We might ask why a character chooses a particular word or the text itself features a word choice that might suggest a particular effect.

The explicit meaning of a word in the text is often determined by diction and leads us to questions about [[tone]]. 

Be careful not to misunderstand [[tone]] or [[diction]] as an excuse for your ignorance about the cultural context of the text. Reading Shakespeare and finding the language difficult isn't about diction--it simply reflects your lack of familiarity with English during the period in which Shakespeare was writing. 

Diction is not about standalone meaning--use a dictionary to figure that out. Diction is about how and why meaning is attached to that particular word--what is the intention behind the use of *that* word. 

Think about how your diction changes when you write an Email to someone of authority--your boss, the police, a lawyer, versus when you write a friend. You make choices about diction based on the context in which you are writing and your desire to be understood in a certain way. Texts do the same thing! 

---

**Tone:**

Tone generally refers to the "voice" of the text. It signals the attitude or posture of the text--the "feel" of a text. The tone of the text might be optimistic, it might be dark; it might be comedic; it might be cautionary; it might be suspenseful; it might be scary; it might be cynical. 

Tone often requires you to look carefully at the [[diction]] of a text--the words being used and the motivation for those words. When you figure out why certain words are being used, you can often decipher the tone. Do the words gravitate to the optimistic or the pessimistic? Are the words meant to be funny or serious? 

Remember, a text can have a tone, but a [[character]] might have a different tone, or convey a tone, that is in conflict with the tone of the text. The [[setting]] might signal tone as well, but it would do so not in the setting itself--Vancouver, for instance--but in the words the text deploys to describe that setting. Vancouver can be bright and optimistic or dark and pessimistic depending on what words one uses to describe it.  

The conflict between the text's tone, the character's tone, and the setting's tone is one area that creates ambiguity and demands interpretation--why are these conflicts present? What do they mean? How are they working to create meaning? What does the conflict represent? 

Be careful that you do not conflate tone with [[style]]. Style most often refers to the author's preferred approach--or technique. One does not describe the text as "written in an mysterious style"; rather, we might say that the style of the text is a mystery or detective story with a "hard-edged" or "creepy" tone. In short, style should refer to [[form->form and structure]] where tone should refer to feel.

---

**Style:**

Style is most often used to refer to how the text is written. It usually refers to elements of [[form and structure]]. We are addressing style if we speak to sentence structure, or comment on the [[narrative]] and its development or order, describe the text as descriptive, or poetic. Generally, style is a "catch-all" term that needs explanation by referring to specifics of [[diction->diction]] or [[tone->tone]]. Style needs specific examples from the text to be clear--one cannot call a text "poetic" without showing some words or sentences from the text that illustrate "poetic" characteristics. 

---

**Text:**

Text refers to any kind of cultural production that be read or interpreted. Most often, text refers to writing--a book, poem, play, advertisement. That noted, text can also refer to any other form of cultural production: movies, music, painting, sculpture, games, televisions shows, etc. As a result, think of text as anything that can be read or interpreted.

- The way you dress can be read, so you are a kind of text (if you are wearing clothes).
- Classrooms are a kind of text--everything in a classroom signals learning, teaching, reading, writing, attentiveness.

---

**Protagonist:**

The protagonist is the character with whom we are most concerned. The protagonist is also often the driver of the main narrative events--impetus, shifts, inconsistencies, or collisions. We are given usually given access to the inner life of the protagonist, but not always. 

The protagonist is usually juxtaposed with an antagonist--someone (or some thing) that is in conflict with the protagonist. This conflict or opposition could be physical, mental, spiritual, political, cultural, moral, racial, etc.

Protagonists are often very complex, conveying multiple layers, drives, and actions. Sometimes we admire them, but other times we find them unlikable. How we understand or interpret the protagonist depends a lot on what kind of [[character->Character]] s/he represents and the [[context->Context]] in which we see how s/he operates. 

 ---

**Structure:**

**Structure:**

Generally, structure refers to the way a text is put into order. A more general way of speaking to textual elements that might help decipher [[narrative structure->Narrative Structure]].  Structure is important because it often signals an important element of textual understanding--time. As well, it may indicate the importance of some textual event (or [[symbol->Symbol]] by featuring it more prominently that other events. 

As well, structure can refer to sentence-level mechanics such as [[syntax->Syntax]], [[tone->Tone]], and [[diction->Diction]]. 

We also encounter structure when we think about what the narrator knows about the story being told and her motivations for sequencing the events as she has done. As with every other case, we always need to attend to the words on the page, but structure things about the order of those words, the sequence of the events those words describe.  

See also: [[genre->Genre]], [[narrative->Narrative Structure]], [[setting->Setting]]

---
 
 **Syntax:**

The order of words in a sentence, and by extension, how words and phrases relate to each other. One way to imagine how syntax works is to imagine how you would represent someone speaking broken English or another native tongue in a way that suggests a lack of familiarity with the language--the way Yoda speaks in *Star Wars* is a classic example of how syntax can impact [[character->Character]]. 

---

**Imagery:**

Imagery refers to the pictures you create in your mind based on your reading of the words on the page. Usually, if you find yourself imagining any of your sense, you are reading imagery. Often, we refer to a specific "image" or repeated [[motif->Motif]] rather than using the term "imagery." 

Imagery is often built up with [[symbol->Symbol]] and [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] such as [[simile->Simile]] and [[metaphor->Metaphor]]. At the same time, other modes of expression such as [[allusion->Allusion]] and [[syntax->Syntax]] can heighten the effect of imagery or an image. 

---

**Character:**

Character refers to the people (maybe animals, houses, robots, or other objects--see [[personification->Personification]] found in the [[text->Text]].  

Characters have different levels of importance, with the main character being the one around whom the story is built or the one shaping the [[narrative->Narrative Structure]]. At the same time, a character or characters will be the anchor for [[point-of-view->Point of View]]. However, any figure who acts, thinks, speaks, or feels is generally a character and can drive the narrative, perhaps hindering the main character, or manipulating the main character. Subordinate characters often have greater [[symbolic->Symbol]] roles. 

Briefly, characters can do some or all of the following: 
<ul><li>speak, move, act, think, and feel.</li>
<li>remain invisible as an entity within the story--often as [[third-person omniscient narrators->Third Person Narrative POV]]</li>
<li>drive the [[structure->Structure]] of the [[narrative->Narrative Structure]] forward, backward, sideways, or nowhere.</li>
<li>act as a [[symbol->Symbol]] within the text.</li>
<li>act as a signal for [[intertextuality->Intertextuality]] or [[allusion->Allusion]].</li>
<li>reflect common and/or prevailing cultural, political, social, and moral expectations.</li>
<li>speak in a [[syntax->Syntax]] that reflects common and/or prevailing cultural, political, social, and moral expectations.</li>
<li>act as an interpreter of [[symbols->Symbol]] and symbolic meaning in the text--a character who always carries a particular object or dresses a certain way.</li> 
<li>place the [[setting->Setting]] of a text--a text where we read the action in the narrator's head.</li>
<li>act as the template or cornerstone for the text's [[tone->Tone]], [[imagery->Imagery]], or [[motif->Motif]].</li></ul>

See also: [[diction->Diction]], [[tone->Tone]]
---

**Setting:**

Setting is the place where the text takes place. Setting often determines the [[context->Context]] in which we receive meaning in the text. 

There can be more than one setting in a text. In particular, different settings can be found within another setting--a room in a house in Vancouver in Canada. Each of these settings (room, house, Vancouver, Canada) can be approached separately or on their own as having an effect on the [[narrative->Narrative]], [[imagery->Imagery]], or [[symbolism->Symbolism]] of the text. 

Generally, the further away from the setting a [[character->Character]] gets, the less relevant the setting becomes. In the above example, Canada would be a general context, whereas the room would be more personalized the character (or the action of the narrative) and thus more relevant to our interpretation. However, if the character is a [[symbol->Symbol]] of national ideals, prevailing morals, or otherwise, the broader--further away--setting would be relevant to the [[context->Context]] of the text. 

Briefly, the setting can include:

<ul><li>a geographic location--real or imagined. This could be a country, a room, a planet, a library.</li> 
<li>the temporal period in which the text takes place--the past, present, or future (in history, a day, or even a different dimension).</li>
<li>the mental, moral, cultural, social, and emotional environment the characters find themselves in.</li></ul>

When thinking about setting, ask some of the following questions:

<ul><li>Why is the text representing the location?</li> 
<li>Do two settings affect each other, manipulate how we see the other, or offer an opposition to the other?</li>
<li>What about the setting is like other settings--does the setting [[allude->Allusion]] to another place or time (real or imagined)? Is the setting a [[symbol->Symbol]]?</li>
<li>How do characters react to different settings? Do those reactions change in response to a particular setting?</li>
<li>Does the setting change? Why does it change and in response to what? </li></ul> 

---

**Genre:**

Genre refers to the type of [[text->Text]] you are looking at, the expectations governing your reading of it, and the conventions associated with that type of text. Genre often provides [[context->Context]] for understanding a text. 

If we identify a text as a poem, then we read it with particular expectations; we look for rhyme, metre, [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] and other signals that we expect in poetry. When we recognize the genre as a novel, we expect conventions such as [[character->Character]] development, an expanded [[narrative->Narrative]], conflict and resolution over a period of time. More specifically, if we are reading detective fiction, we expect a dead body , an unknown assailant, and a smart detective; if we are reading a romance novel, we expect a love affair often set in an exotic locale. Likewise, advertising, movies, and games are also genres with their own set of conventions. All of the above examples refer to genre. 

Genre is interesting because in setting the context for how we receive a text, it can defy expectations or deploy them in interesting ways. 

Some examples of common genres: mystery, detective fiction, true crime, young adult, epic, [[ballad->Ballad]], romance, science-fiction. As well, genres can be combined: poetic-fantasy, detective-romance.

---

**Motif:**

Motif refers to a pattern that, throughout the text, creates meaning. Motif usually refers to a repeated [[image->Imagery]], [[character-type->Character]] or [[symbol->Symbol]] that comes to have meaning to some element of the [[text->Text]].  

Motifs can be locked to a text--specific to that text. Or, they can reflect larger cultural, economic, or moral / religious sentiments--we see this most obviously in [[symbols->Symbol]] such as roses and hearts meaning love, crosses meaning religion, white meaning innocence, purity, and cleanliness. 

Motifs are not always symbols. They can be actions as well--the repeated action of running away, or of lighting a cigarette, or drinking a cup of coffee. The important things is that the action (or symbol / image) must be repeated throughout the text, not simply a one-off. If it is a one-off, you're probably better off dealing with it as a [[symbol->Symbol]] or [[image->Image]].

---

**Symbol**

A symbol is something the meaning of which refers to something other than its literal meaning. 

A symbol usually refers to a word, [[image->Image]], or [[motif->Motif]] that represents a larger, more complex idea, [[context->Context]], or image than the literal meaning of the word, image, or motif might represent. For example, the Canadian flag is a symbol for the socio-cultural freedoms the country represents; the beaver is a Canadian symbol meant to suggest both our connection to the land and our work ethic. 

However, the word, image, or motif--the [[signal->Signal]]--for the symbol does not lose its literal meaning. As Gertrude Stein famously wrote: "a rose is a rose is a rose." While symbols are important and have many layers of meaning, it is important to remember that they are also simply words; they can shift over time and reflect something different than they did originally.  

See also: [[character->Character]], [[figurative language->Figurative Language]], [[setting->Setting]].

---

**Signal:**

Signal is a term used to disassociated the literary element from its possible connection to convention. We use signal to indicate something about how the [[image->Image]], [[character->Character]], [[setting->Setting]], [[context->Context]], etc. suggests meaning. 

A character might "signal" a particular [[motif->Motif]]. A [[setting->Setting]] might "signal" a particular context. The [[point-of-view->Point of View]] might "signal" a particular political, ethical, or social belief system. An action might "signal" a hidden meaning or ambiguity in the text's meaning. 

---

**Personification:**

Personification is [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] that gives human traits (qualities, feelings, action, or characteristics) to animals, non-living objects, or ideas (like things, colours, qualities, even abstract ideals).

See also: [[character->Character]]

---

**Metaphor:**

A metaphor is the juxtaposition of two (usually different) things that, when read together, come to mean something different and often provide a heightened [[image--Imagery]] in the mind of the reader. They often describe one thing in terms of another--using [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] to make the two things into one image.

Some examples: 

<ul><li>The boat plows through the water--boats and plows are different, but the image of the boat plowing through the water is vivid when they are put together.</li>
<li>That man is a toad--he's not literally a toad. But, when he is put together with one, we sure get a sense of his [[character->Character]].</li>

Beware the separation of [[simile->Simile]] and metaphor; a simile is a kind of metaphor using like or as. [[Personification->Personification]] is another kind of metaphor.

---

**Simile:**

A simile is a kind of [[metaphor->Metaphor]] that makes a comparison using the words "like" or "as." It is a type of [[figurative language->Figurative Language]] and as such attempts to heighten the impact of language and create a lasting [[image->Image]] or [[symbol->Symbol]].

---

**Narrative Structure:**

Narrative and/or narrative structure in literary studies most often refers to the way a story is told--how the [[narrator->Narrator]] tells the story (embellishments, [[language->Figurative Language]], [[tone->Tone]], [[point-of-view->Point of View]]. In other words, we want to focus in on the [[structure->Structure]] of the [[text->Text]] we are reading. We might also refer to narrative or narrative structure as "plot." 

Make sure not to conflate story and narrative or plot when encountering a text. We most often use the word story to refer to the events or action in a text--we often do this in chronological order. Narrative structure or plot refers to how the narrator organizes those events or actions. 

We address story when we are looking at the effect of [[character->Character]], [[setting->Setting]], or conflicts that push the events forward (or backwards). 

We address narrative or plot when conflicts, tensions, ambiguities, mysteries are resolved, made more opaque, or sent in a new direction that changes how we receive information from the text.  

Narratives are either non-liner or linear. That is, they take place as a sequence of chronological events one after the other (linear) or they take place in a non-sequential order using flash-backs and/or flash-forwards. In either case, there may be one or more [[narrators->Narrator]] telling the story or constructing the narrative (plot).

---

**Narrator:**

The narrator is the one who tells the story. She/He/They may or may not be a [[character->Character]] in the text. At the same time, the narrator(s) might not even be implicated directly in the action(s) central to the text's conflicts, ambiguities, or mysteries. However, in every case,the narrator(s) relate(s) the information the reader is receiving, giving it [[structure->Narrative Structure]] and purpose. There can be more than one narrator. 

Narrators can tell a story from a number of different perspectives or [[points-of-view->Point of View]]. Stories can be [[narrated->Narrative Structure]] through a [[first-person->First Person Narrative POV]], [[third-person->Third Person Narrative POV]], or second-person (rare), point-of-view, all with differing degrees of access. We need to determine what point-of-view a narrator is using because doing so often reveals biases, embellishments, and establishes the reliability or unreliability of the narrator.    

We also want to pay close attention to the choices the narrator makes in constructing the [[narrative->Narrative Structure]]. In particular, we want to be aware of cultural, social, economic, racial, etc., [[signals->Signal]] that might appear in the story through [[symbols->Symbol]], common [[images->Imagery]], or [[intertextual->Intertextuality]] references. 

---

**Point-of-View:**

Point-of-view (sometimes "focalization") refers to the perspective of a narrator or character in a text. Given that the narrator can be a character in the text, we most often refer to point-of-view only in terms of the narrator. When looking at the social, cultural, moral, aesthetic, or otherwise perspectives of a particular character (not the narrator), we might also refer to point-of-view. However, in this case we are often outside discussions of [[narrative->Narrative Structure]] structure or plot because that character, if not the narrator, has no direct role in shaping the structure of events.  

There are some texts that feature multiple characters relating the same story from multiple perspectives. There are others that directly involve the reader in the action (by referring to them explicitly as "you" or by allowing them to choose the text narrative move--a choose your own adventure). 

Point-of-view falls into one of the following structures:
<ul><li>[[First-person->First Person Narrative POV]]</li> 
<li>[[third-person limited->Third Person Narrative POV]]</li>
<li> [[third-person omniscient->Third Person Narrative POV]]</li>
<li>second-person (rare) --when the text calls on you. E.g. "You are reading this text"</li></ul>
We need to determine what point-of-view a narrator is using because doing so often reveals biases, embellishments, and establishes the reliability or unreliability of the narrator. We Also want to be aware of point-of-view to expose any ambiguities, inconsistencies, tendencies of the [[narrator->Narrator]] that might expose motivations and [[signal->Signal]] intent. We might then gain insight into the social conventions underlying the perspective the cultural production (or text) might be foregrounding.    

---

**First Person Narrative POV:**

First-person narrative refers to a [[narrator->Narrator]] who is a [[character->Character]] in the [[text->Text]] and is telling his or her own [[story->Narrative Structure]]. Most often, the first-person narrator uses the pronoun "I" and in so doing asserts his or her own agency in the story. 

We often have access to the first-person narrator's inner thoughts and consciousness because s/he is a [[protagonist->Protagonist]] in the text. 

Because they are relating events to readers through a first-person perspective (or point-of-view), first-person narrators have a limited view of the events. They are not necessarily aware of how events are going to unfold or, they might *already* be aware of how events unfolded. The [[narrative structure->Narrative Structure]],  or textual [[structure->Structure]] more generally, will often reveal the narrator's position in history and reveal what s/he knows about the story events or outcomes.

The importance of establishing what a first-person narrator knows or does not know, what s/he might be leaving out or including, what s/he might be embellishing or obfuscating, is important in determining hidden agendas or polemics behind a seemingly benign story. 

---

**Third Person Narrative POV:**

Third-person narrative refers to a [[narrator->Narrator]] who refers to everyone in the story as "he," "she," "it," or "they," but never as "I" or "we" (which would [[signal->Signal]] [[first-person narrative->First Person Narrative POV]]. 

The third person narrator appears to be conveying the story rather than participating in it. Their presence as the storyteller is rarely explained and their motivation for relating the story is ambiguous. The [[text->Text]] comes to us through a disembodied voice, or "god-like" perspective. 

The third-person narrative usually falls into one of two categories:

**Subjective / Objective:**
<ul><li>Subjective: narrator describes one or more consciousness(es) and has access to all their perspectives (thoughts, feelings, motivations, etc.).</li> 
<li>Objective: narrator describes no character consciousness, ignoring the all characters' inner worlds. This third-person objective narrator appears to be entirely trustworthy, relating the exact events of the story without the implied bias of description or unfettered access.</li></ul>
**Omniscient / Limited:**
<ul><li>Omniscient: narrator seems to know everything about everything that ever was or will be when it comes to the story. S/he knows every thought, the history of every place, the beginning and end to every story / fact / event that has ever happened in the story world--total and complete insight.</li>
<li>Limited: narrator's omniscience is limited to only one character (sometimes more than one but rarely) and what they have experienced of the story world. The limited narrator cannot extend beyond the perspective of one character. S/he cannot know anything outside that character's perspective (sometimes referred to as having "over-the-shoulder" perspective).</li></ul>

The different narrative perspectives of third-person narrative point-of-view can be overwhelming. However, we're looking at the point-of-view in order to determine the motivations, biases, embellishments, stereotypes, etc., being deployed by the narrator and how these might impact our reception of the [[text->Text]].

---

**Allusion:**

Allusion is a word, [[image->Imagery]], [[setting->Setting]], [[character->Character]], [[symbol->Symbol]]. or even [[structure->Structure]] that references something else, often outside the [[text->Text]]. Allusion most often occurs when the text makes reference to something outside the confines of its own events, usually to some form of [[cultural production->Cultural Production]]. 

Allusion is useful for interpreting a text's connection to other forms of cultural production or for understanding areas where the text might be setting [[context->Context]] for its reception. Allusion is closely related to [[intertextuality->Intertextuality]].

Allusions are important because they often [[signal->Signal]] deeper meaning in the text, enhance the effect of [[figurative language->Figurative Language]], give hints about the role of context in understanding character actions, [[perspectives->Point of View]], or [[narrative structure->Narrative Structure]].

---

**Intertextuality:**

Intertextuality refers to the connections between texts or, how a text speaks to--represents--another [[text->Text]]. The texts being referred to can be any form of [[cultural production->Cultural Production]]--movies, books, poems, music, theatre, television--or the [[characters->Character]], [[settings->Setting]], [[plot-lines->Narrative Structure]], or [[symbols->Symbol]] that appear in cultural production. 

Like [[allusion->Allusion]], intertextuality enhances meaning in a text by connecting events, characters, [[images->Imagery]], etc., to a shared cultural history or cultural understanding based in cultural production. 

---

**Cultural Production:**

Cultural production refers to the manner in which shared values are distributed through the creative endeavours of a particular population. Most often, cultural production is understood as referring to elements of the culture industry--movies, music, painting, literature, and any of the other Arts. 

We often use cultural production as a general term meaning all the texts--no matter the medium--that a given culture produces. As such, the framework or [[context->Context]] for understanding a [[text->Text]]--why a particular [[genre->Genre]], [[character->Character]] archetype, or [[plot-line->Narrative Structure]] is prevalent in cultural narratives or themes (a particular brand of heroism, particular roles for women, or racial stereotypes). 

With the above in mind, it is important to remember that cultural production can also refer to the productions (texts) of culture that serves a nationalist purpose, such as propaganda, or that might create a shared system of values--advertising, religious or racial profiling, and political perspectives. 

---

**Theme:**

Theme refers to the unifying subject or idea in a [[text->Text]]. Themes usually refer to universal ideas about life, society, or human actions. At the same time, a theme is not a topic. Instead, themes are prevailing--often cultural--ideas explored within a text--questions of morality, mortality, fidelity, idealism, nationalism. In short, a theme is what a text *represents*, not what it is about. 

Often, the central conflict in a text is built around a [[character's->Character]] transgression of familiar boundaries or accepted norms represented in theme. As well, certain [[symbols->Symbol]] might suggest thematic transgressions where a character might not explicitly behave outside what we expect. At the same time, our understanding of themes common to particular modes of  [[cultural production->Cultural Production]] may influence how we understand the [[context->Context]] of the story. 

Themes can only be identified by closely examining the interplay between [[narrative structure->Narrative Structure]], character, [[point-of-view->Point of View]], and [[symbols->Symbol]]. As a result, the same story can be told over and over again, across numerous texts, but highlight different themes in each case. Unlike most symbols, themes are not bound to the text in which we identify them.

**Figure of Speech:**

Figure of speech is a catch-all phrase that refers to the literary devices used in figurative language. Called tropes by some folks, figures of speech take meaning to another level (to the figurative, beyond the literal), and come in all shapes and sizes. Figures of speech include metaphors, similes, and personification.

In our everyday conversations, we often use "figure of speech" to refer to a common metaphor that everyone understands. So when you tell your mother that you love her to death and she looks horrified, you can say, "Aw, it's okay, Ma. That's just a figure of speech." But then again, she probably already knew that.
